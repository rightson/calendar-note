# Calendar-Note

Calendar-Note brings local events and optional read-only iCal calendars into Obsidian. Events link to Markdown Event Notes and the matching Daily Note; a sidebar can also open Weekly Notes. It includes Week, Day, Month, Year, Custom days, and List views, plus a compact month calendar for the sidebar.

## Install

Calendar-Note requires **Obsidian 1.14.5 or later** and supports desktop Obsidian. The plugin has not been submitted to the Community Plugins directory, so it is not available through Obsidian's built-in plugin browser yet.

- **Download and install:** [Download the latest ZIP](https://github.com/rightson/calendar-note/releases/latest/download/calendar-note.zip) and follow the [manual installation guide](docs/manuals/INSTALLATION.md).
- **Install with BRAT:** Install BRAT from Community Plugins, then add `rightson/calendar-note` as a beta plugin. See the [BRAT installation guide](docs/manuals/INSTALLATION.md#install-with-brat).
- [View all GitHub releases](https://github.com/rightson/calendar-note/releases).

## Use

Open the calendar from the ribbon icon or the command palette. Create a local event from **New event** or an empty calendar slot. The event is saved as a Markdown Event Note and linked under `## Events` in the Daily Note for its start date. Click a date to open its Daily Note; the sidebar's week number opens that Weekly Note. Settings → **Clicking** customizes what a click does; see [Click behavior](#click-behavior). Right-click the calendar to open a menu: **New event** creates one at that time, and an **Edit** entry appears for each event at that time (or on that day in Month view), so overlapping events can each be reached. To use a different note for an event, open its details from that menu or from **⋯** and choose **Change…** beside Event Note: pick any Markdown note or type a new path. The previous Event Note stays in the Vault as an ordinary note with its text intact. If Event Notes conflict or cannot be read (for example, a duplicated note with the same `event_id`), run **Review Event Note problems** or click the toolbar's problem button: each problem lists the notes side by side, highlights what differs, recommends which to keep, and fixes it in place.

### Click behavior

Settings → **Clicking** chooses what a left-click does in each calendar:

| Setting | Where | Options |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Clicking a date in the mini calendar** | The calendar on the left of the Calendar Note tab | **Go to the date in the main calendar** (default) · **Go to the date and open its Daily Note beside the calendar** · **Go to the date and open its Daily Note in a new tab** |
| **Clicking an empty slot in the main calendar** | A time slot or date cell with no event in the main calendar on the right | **New event in Week and Day; Daily Note in Month and Year** (default) · **Always create a new event** · **Open the Daily Note beside the calendar** · **Open the Daily Note in a new tab** · **Do nothing** |
| **Clicking an event** | An event in the main calendar | **Show event details** (default) · **Open Event Note beside the calendar** · **Open Event Note in a new tab** |

- "Beside the calendar" reuses one note pane next to the calendar while it stays open; "a new tab" opens on the calendar's far side so the calendar stays in view.
- With the main calendar hidden, **Go to the date** opens the Daily Note beside the calendar, since there is no main calendar to move.
- **Always create a new event** makes an all-day event in Month and Year views and in the all-day row.
- These settings change only a plain left-click on an empty spot or a mini-calendar date. Date headers, day numbers, and week numbers always open their Daily or Weekly Note. Right-click always shows **New event** and **Edit** entries. An event's **⋯** button always shows its details.

### Month calendar in the sidebar

A compact month calendar, like a calendar widget, sits beside your notes. It is a separate view from the mini calendar inside the Calendar Note tab, so it stays visible while you work in notes. It starts at the current month and adds the following months as long as whole months fit the panel's height.

- **Where it appears:** it is added to the right sidebar when Obsidian starts, unless it is already open somewhere. Drag its tab anywhere; it stays where you put it on later starts. To stack it under the file explorer in the left sidebar, one above the other, drag it there or run **Move month calendar below the file explorer** (also a button in settings). Run **Open month calendar in sidebar** to bring it back after closing it.
- **How many months:** a taller panel shows more months, and a wide panel lays them out side by side. In a short panel the month cards get smaller, in up to three steps, until the number of months set in **Show at least** fits. Cards only shrink when that shows an extra month.
- **Opening notes:** click a date to open its Daily Note, or a week number to open its Weekly Note, in the main area. Ctrl/Cmd-click opens it in a new tab.
- **What it marks:** dots under a date show its events (up to three), bold dates already have a Daily Note, and the Daily Note you are viewing is highlighted. Today is outlined.
- **Moving through months:** use **‹** and **›**, or scroll over the months; **Today** returns to the current month.
- Subscribed events are marked only for the dates the main calendar has loaded; local events are always marked.

Settings under **Month calendar**:

| Setting | Default | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Add to the right sidebar at startup | On | Adds the month calendar at startup when it is not open anywhere. Turn it off to keep it closed. |
| Show at least | 3 months | In a short panel, month cards shrink until this many months fit (1–12). |
| Place below the file explorer | — | Moves the month calendar under the file explorer in the left sidebar. |

### Subscriptions

Subscriptions are optional. Add an HTTPS or `webcal://` feed in settings to display read-only calendar events. Local events work without a subscription. Imported calendar data is cached for use in the calendar, and event changes can be reviewed in History. Removing the plugin or a feed does not delete Vault notes.

### Where Event Notes go

The **Event Note pattern** setting decides where new Event Notes are created. It accepts Moment date tokens and `{title}`, `{calendar}`, and `{uid}`; the default is `[Calendar Notes]/{title}`.

To keep Event Notes beside their Daily Notes, start the pattern with `{daily}`. It stands for the folder of the event's Daily Note. For example, with Daily Notes in `Journal` using the format `YYYY/MM/YYYY-MM-DD`:

| Pattern | Event on 2026-10-23 |
|---|---|
| `{daily}/{title}` | `Journal/2026/10/<title>.md` |
| `{daily}/[Events]/{title}` | `Journal/2026/10/Events/<title>.md` |

`{daily}` must be the first part of the pattern and be followed by `/`.

When an event moves to another date, its Event Note moves with it to the folder the pattern gives for the new date. This applies whether you drag the event, edit it in the calendar, change `start` in the note, or a subscription changes it. Obsidian updates links to the note as for any rename (when **Automatically update internal links** is on), and the Daily Note entry moves to the new Daily Note. A note you renamed keeps its name; if the target name is taken, a number is added, as in `Standup (2).md`. Notes you moved out of the pattern's folder yourself, or chose with **Change…**, stay where they are. A pattern without date folders, such as the default, never moves notes. Changing the pattern or Daily Notes settings affects new notes only.

To keep Event Notes where they were created, turn off **Move Event Notes when dates change** in settings (it is on by default). The Daily Note entry still moves to the new date and links to the note where it is. Turning the setting off also cancels any move that has not happened yet.

## Privacy and compatibility

No account or telemetry is required. Calendar-Note makes read-only HTTPS requests only to fetch calendar feeds whose URLs you configure. Feed URLs, raw ICS responses, settings, history, link tracking, and recovery data are stored in Obsidian's private plugin data; Event, Daily, and Weekly Notes are written to your Vault. The plugin does not access files outside the Vault and its plugin data folder.

Event Note Properties behavior depends on Obsidian's native editor DOM and is feature-detected; if the property panel is unavailable or hidden, Calendar-Note leaves it alone. Daily and Weekly Note provider settings are detected through internal Obsidian/plugin state because there is no public provider API, so provider updates may require compatibility changes.

Calendar-Note is licensed under [MIT](LICENSE). Third-party dependency license text is embedded in the release `main.js` and included as `THIRD_PARTY_LICENSES.txt` in the package ZIP.
